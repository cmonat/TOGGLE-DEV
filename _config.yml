# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find

# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  TOGGLE (Toolbox for generic NGS analyses) is a suite of tools able to design pipelines that manage large sets of NGS softwares
  and utilities. Moreover, TOGGLE offers an easy way to manipulate the various options of the different softwares through the
  pipelines in using a single basic configuration file, which can be changed for each assay without having to change the code itself.
  We also describe one implementation of TOGGLE in a complete analysis pipeline designed for SNP discovery for large sets of
  genomic data, ready to use in different environments (from a single machine to HPC clusters).
